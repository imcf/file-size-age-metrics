# 📐 ⏱ 🧮 File-Size-Age Metrics Exporter

[Prometheus][1] exporter providing size and age metrics about files.

## ⚙🔧 Installation ⚙🔧

Example installation on Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
# required for creating Python virtualenvs:
apt update
apt install -y python3-venv

# create a virtualenv in /opt:
python3 -m venv /opt/fsa-metrics

# update 'pip' and install the 'file-size-age-metrics' package:
/opt/fsa-metrics/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
/opt/fsa-metrics/bin/pip install file-size-age-metrics
```

## 🏃 Running in foreground mode 🏃

This is mostly relevant for testing configuration settings and checking if the
exporter works as expected - to do this either activate the previously created
Python environment or call the `fsa-metrics` script using the full path to that
environment.

A configuration file is required for running the metrics exporter. Simply copy
the [config-example.yaml][3] file to e.g. `config.yaml` and adjust the settings
there (alternatively, call `fsa-metrics --config SHOWCONFIGDEFAULTS` to have a
configuration example printed to stdout). Then run the exporter like this:

```bash
fsa-metrics --config config.yaml
```

The exporter running in foreground can be terminated as usual via `Ctrl+C`.

## 👟 Running as a service 👟

```bash
adduser --system fsaexporter
cp -v /opt/fsa-metrics/lib/python*/site-packages/resources/systemd/fsa-metrics.service  /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl edit fsa-metrics.service
```

The last command will open an editor with the override configuration of the
service's unit file. Add a section like this **at the top** of the override
file, specifying where to find your configuration file for the service:

```text
[Service]
### configuration file for the FSA exporter service:
Environment=FSA_CONFIG=/etc/fsa-metrics.yaml
```

Note: on *Ubuntu 20.04* the `systemct edit` command will present you with an
empty file, so you will have to copy the respective lines from below or the
provided *central* unit file.

Finally enable the service and start it right away. The second line will show
the log messages on the console until `Ctrl+C` is pressed. This way you should
be able to tell if the service has started up properly and is providing metrics
on the configured port:

```bash
systemctl enable --now fsa-metrics.service
journalctl --follow --unit fsa-metrics
```

Open ports for the `fsa-metrics` exporter:

```bash
SOURCE="any"  # <-- put an IP address here to restrict access more
ufw allow from $SOURCE to any port fsa-metrics
```

## Known limitations

Currently only a single directory tree can be monitored. Adding support for
monitoring several trees with a single process is planned though.

## Scalability and resource usage considerations

The exporter is designed with code simplicity as a goal, it's *not* optimized
for efficiency or low resource usage. A few numbers on an average laptop running
the exporter on a rather large file tree (not recommended, just for
demonstration purposes):

- Number of files monitored: ~200'000
- Memory consumption: ~350 MB
- Metrics collection duration: < 10s
